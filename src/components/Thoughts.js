            Itâ€™s been a weird start to this decade, the fact that a pandemic is
            currently putting entire countries in quarantine is something that
            happens on planet earth in the movie universe, not on the actual
            planet we all live on. Well that was what I thought at least.

            The second sprint, and first part, of the course is over. It feels a
            bit surreal to be honest. When I applied to attend the Technigo
            bootcamp I was so nervous and spent way too many hours on the code
            application. The suggested amount of hours was about four but I
            spent close to three days.
