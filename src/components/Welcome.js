          I enjoy taking care of my plants and bouldering. Bouldering matches my
          passion for programming because they both focus on solving problems.
          Getting from point A to point B as effectively and graciously as
          possible is just as fun for me if Iâ€™m climbing or coding. My fingers
          are the common denominator that makes both things a lot easier to
          perform.
